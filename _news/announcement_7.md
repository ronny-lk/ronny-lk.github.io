<strong>Seminar.</strong> NeMLA 2024. [Frame Narratives: Then and Now](https://cfplist.com/nemla/Home/S/20526)

*** 

The frame narrative has often been theorized as the vestibule of a text, an “undefined zone” between an inner story and outside world. The interplay between narrative levels and their mediation vis-à-vis the frame invites confrontation with historically situated questions of presence and absence, of authority and trust, of naming and anonymity. When taken as a formal index of literary change, the ubiquity of frames across periods and genres offers significant insights into the historical contingency of such confrontations.
<br><br/>
If frame narratives provide a useful site of narratological inquiry at the intersection of New Formalism (Levine, Levinson, Kramnick & Nersessian) and New Historicism (Foucault, Greenblatt, Vesser), this seminar seeks papers that explore how changing cultural conditions inform the possibility, formation, and stability of narrative frames, broadly construed.
<br><br/>
This seminar asks us to consider the characteristics of the frame at various historical junctures: To what extent does the frame prove able to keep pace with shifting modes of cultural production and reception? Does the frame retain narrative integrity in the post-digital age? If the frame once felt idiosyncratically literary, how might we map our understanding onto new and emerging narratives and objects?
<br><br/>
Possible topics might include:

<li>Frames as structures of and structuring narratological authority</li>
<li>The frame as a specific type of beginning or ending, as a form of entry or closure</li>
<li>How frames translate across genres</li>
<li>Frames in/as metafiction</li>
<li>Paratext as framing</li>
<li>Reading canonical frames today</li>
<li>The interplay between frames and contemporary technologies</li>
<br>
In conversation with NeMLA's 2024 theme, “surplus,” we welcome papers that question the positionality of frames as “outside” the story or extraneous to diegesis proper and thus a form of excess.
