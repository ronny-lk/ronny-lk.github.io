The first consists of research on the nature and practices of science and technology. Studies in this genre approach science and technology as social institutions possessing distinctive structures, commitments, practices, and discourses that vary across cultures and change over time. This line of work addresses theorhetical questions such as: is there a scientific method; what makes scientific facts credible; and how new disciplines emerge? The second stream concerns the impacts of science and technology, with particular focus on the risks, benefits and opportunities that science may pose to peace, security, community, democracy, environmental sustainability, and human values. Driving this body of research are questions like: how should states set priorities for research funding; who should participate, and how, in technological decision making; should life forms be patented; how should societies measure risks and set safety standards; and how should experts communicate the reasons for their judgments to the public?</p> <p>The rise of STS as a teaching field reflects a dawning recognition that specialization in today’s research universities does not fully prepare scholars nor citizens to respond knowledgeably and reflectively to the most important challenges of the contemporary world. Increasingly, the dilemmas that confront people, whether in government, industry, politics or daily life, cut across the conventional lines of academic training and thought.</p> <div class="row justify-content-sm-center"> <div class="col-sm-6 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/bg_plant-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/bg_plant-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/bg_plant-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/bg_plant.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="example image" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm-6 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/bg_plant2-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/bg_plant2-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/bg_plant2-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/bg_plant2.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="example image" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Engravings of the hedysarum gyrans (the telegraph plant) and medina from Erasmus Darwin's <em>The Botanic Garden</em> (1806), by William Blake. </div> <p><strong> Themes of Interest </strong></p> <div></div> <p><em> History of technology. </em> Examining technology, including new and emerging technologies in their social and historical context.

Ted Chiang’s short story, “Story of Your Life,” employs the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis to explore the consequences of a linguistic exchange between humans and the octopus-esque aliens who arrive on Earth.</p> <p>These two philosophically oriented works engage the notion that perception is contingent on both body and language. This session is dedicated to the rather rhizomatic integration of Godfrey-Smith and Chiang through Deleuze and Guattari’s <em>A Thousand Plateaus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia</em>, in which humanity’s relation to the animal world is kaleidoscopically reimagined as an infinite network of correspondences.</p> <p>Literary Object: <a href="https://mcgill.on.worldcat.org/oclc/957696590" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Other Minds: The Octopus, the Sea, and the Deep Origins of Consciousness</a> by Peter Godfrey-Smith, <a href="https://mcgill.on.worldcat.org/oclc/928119950" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">“Story of Your Life”</a> by Ted Chiang.</p> <p>Critical Companion: Selections from <a href="https://mcgill.on.worldcat.org/oclc/16472336" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">A Thousand Plateaus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia</a> by Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari.</p> <p><a href="chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://static1.squarespace.com/static/62a93146e7a77f6497e8af5a/t/6383ecfd3d868e2a631060d9/1669590280198/Cephalopods%2C+Consciousness%2C+and+Communication.pdf">Slides</a></p> <center> *** </center> <p><br></p> <p><strong><em>Darwiniana: The Blacker-Wood Natural History Collection</em></strong> <br> Thursday, June 16, 2022 - 1:00 p.m. 2:30 p.m. - McGill Rare Books and Special Collections</p> <p>To complement our discussion on human evolution in the wake of Darwinism, we will be visiting Rare Books and Special Collections to view archival materials on Darwin and his contemporaries.

If Darwinism forces us to confront our own animality, this session asks what would it mean to imagine a post-human evolution , an evolutionary future where humanity is eclipsed by their descendants.</p> <p>Kurt Vonnegut’s novel <em>Galápagos</em> (1985) imagines the post-human evolution at its extreme, laying out an apocalyptic vision of Earth ravaged by war and famine and its remaining inhabitants: the sole survivors of our species. A satirical take on “the survival of the fittest,” a phrase often misattributed to Darwin, <em>Galápagos</em> asks what it means for a species to evolve to the point of self-destruction.</p> <p>Looking outward from the text, we will consider the role of the humanities in the cultural study of science . As Elizabeth Grosz asks: “What is the trajectory of a newly considered humanities, one that seeks to know itself not in opposition to its others, the ‘‘others’’ of the human, but in continuity with them? What would a humanities look like that does not rely on an opposition between self and other, in which the other is always in some way associated with animality or the nonhuman?”</p> <p>Literary Object: <a href="https://mcgill.on.worldcat.org/oclc/69421806" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Galápagos</a> by Kurt Vonnegut</p> <p>Critical Companion: “The Inhuman in the Humanities” from <a href="https://mcgill.on.worldcat.org/oclc/700406615" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Becoming Undone : Darwinian Reflections on Life, Politics, and Art</a> by Elizabeth Grosz</p> <p><a href="chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://static1.squarespace.com/static/62a93146e7a77f6497e8af5a/t/6383edc4c9738519a5fb2f77/1669590471901/Posthuman+Evolution.pdf">Slides</a></p> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2024 Ronny Litvack-Katzman.
