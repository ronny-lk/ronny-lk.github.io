I am a graduate student in the [Department of English](https://mcgill.ca/english/) at [McGill University](https://mcgill.ca).

#### Research Interests

My research is motivated by the ambiguous "and" in literature and science, propelled by questions at the intersection of literary theory and the cultural study of science. While much of my research focuses on British science fiction in the long nineteenth century, my interests are not bound by period or genre, venturing from Romantic poetry to contemporary novels. My SSHRC-supported thesis work explored the use of frame narration as a strategy to make sense of the Darwinian unnatural in [H.G. Wells's scientific romances](https://ronny-lk.github.io/_projects/2_project/). My public scholarship includes digtial projects looking at the history of nineteenth century [British newspapers](https://ronny-lk.github.io/_projects/1_project/) and connecting humanities scholars with their [peers in the sciences](https://ronny-lk.github.io/projects/3_project/).

#### Professional Interests

Coincident with my academic work, I am interested in science communication, academic publishing, and information-communication systems. I have served on a number of editorial boards in both editing and production roles. 

Outside of work, I write poetry which I share primarily through [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/ronnyshai/), but can also be found in [Yolk](https://www.yolkliterary.ca/) and [Garbage Day](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aUV0wP39-2DiLM0O_HfbPN135CgDeOPM/view). I am working to self-publish a chapbook in 2024.
